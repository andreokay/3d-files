# Summary

Hi community,
inspired by Krapozoks cool RasPi mount for 19" Rack, I've tried my very best to integrate an 2,5" HDD. 
Win 10 3D Builder and 2 left hands left some scars on the Remix of Krapozok's Design (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1793758), Display-Integration of indiBITde (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2879686) and SSD frame from cmpunter (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:552706) + few blocks :)
Any Remix or Reuse of this simple idea with less scars and same stability is highly welcome!
Tried a first print at 2mm thickness, but was to weak to carry a 15mm 3TB 2.5" HDD + Pi. Switched to 4mm (0.2 mm layer, 1 mm bottom/top, 1.2 mm walls, 50% infill with 0.4mm nozzle) works fine. 
Done a version with a hideable USB-Inlet to connect one of those cheap USB 2.0 SATA cables instead of SATA HAT. If no longer needed add this little cap.

What was already written in the other things comments regarding the necessary frame:
Available from Germany: https://www.musicstore.de/fr_BE/EUR/DAP-Audio-2-HE-Rackblende-f-Modulsystem-10-Segmente/art-PAH0017160-000
Available from Amazon.com: https://www.amazon.com/Modular-connector-frame-holds-panels/dp/B000X920KQ/

Frame offers space for 10 segments, 1-5 Raspberries + Cover.

... currently printing. Will add a picture soon.

EDIT: Printed and drilled small hole for front-dc-jack .. going to add modell too.
Within closed rack. 5V 3A no-name plug powers home-automation Pi3 (FHEM with 100+ devices) with a 750GB 2,5" HDD + fallback Pi2 with rsync and minor duties with a 3TB 2,5" HDD
Pi3 Core Temp is at ~50°, HDD at 40°, Roomtemp at 24°, no fan ... hope it lasts a while like this :)
