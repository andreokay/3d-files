THIS IS A WIP AS I HAVE NOT POWERED ON THE FAN AND ACTUALLY TESTED IT YET (DIMENSIONS ARE ACCURATE THOUGH)
THIS IS ALS A WIP AS I'M RUSHING TO TYPE THIS.

Hey!

I printed the original of this filter and realised it was just too bulky for what I was imagining.  So I recreated it to fit within the depth of an Ikea Lack Table.

I also changed the dimensions of where the HEPA filter goes as in New Zealand I could not easily find the filter used in the original. (EDIT: I've now uploaded the original HEPA filter dimension version of this, named "main_unit_origHEPAdimensions__v01.stl" -- cutting guide, & filter dimensions can stay the same)

This comes with a cutting guide to help line the top and bottom cuts in the table you will have to do to use this filter.

I also included the top cover and inner cover from the original creation also so this can be a 'one-stop-shop' download.

Please post a comment if you would like any dimensions tweaked.

CHEERS!
Jeremy

As per request, I added "main_unit_origHEPAdimensions__v01.stl" which has the HEPA filter dimensions from the original Thing so people can use those HEPA filters.
