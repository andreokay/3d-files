With this X Carriage You can use most of extruder / hotend mounts designed for Prusa I3 on Anycubic i3 Mega. (Prusa has 45 mm rod spacing, on I3 Mega it's 50 mm) I'm using this one which is really great:

It's simple, compact, easy to use and really stable. Also I have no problem with cooling now.

It's remixed from this X Carriage:

Attention!
You need to invert X motor spin direction!
