# Summary

This is a followup to:

without further adieu....

Attack 6: Pass the Lack

Once I lit the Lack, the next step was to get the power cables out of the stack and filament into the stack...

I looked at some at Home Depot, saw some on Thinkgiverse, decided instead to make my own passthroughs for it as I wanted a single port/type that could be used for multiple things. So far I've built a filament filter insert as well as cable inserts, (and a blankoff), I'm sure I'll come up with a few more as time goes on... 

As always, comments are greatly appreciated, If you've made/fixed something to work better please let me know so I can fix it for others.

Coming Next: 
Attack 7: not sure yet, likely remote mounting the display & Octopi...

# Post-Printing

## Build & Assembly Notes:

Another simple build:
1. Print the parts as needed.
2. For each port use 2 1/8" a hole saw to drill each port.
3. Insert the port through the table, tap it down with a rubber mallet flush, snap the lock ring on the bottom to finish off the edge.
4a. For the filament filter pass-through cut a piece of foam to fit in the filter, snap the bottom on, then use a large needle/stiff wire to push holes through for each of the openings. pulling the filament to the side when you're done with it will lock it in place.
4b. for the Wire passthroughs feed your wires through, pop in a cover, and done!
