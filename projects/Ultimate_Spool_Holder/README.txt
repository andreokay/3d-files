# Summary

Inspired by the TUSH spool holder. This has been completely remodelled in Sketch Up, copying much of the design from the TUSH.
It uses a single base in the centre for the spool holders to snap into. This centre holder can be epoxied into place like it is on my DaVinci. The base is VERY long and can accomodate very large spools, or two small ones.
In the last photo, it is compared to the original TUSH.
It uses standard cheap 608 bearings. You must print four of the body pieces and one base to make this.

# Print Settings

Printer: DAVINCI 1.0
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 20% Honeycomb

Notes: 
Extrusion multiplier on my DaVinci has been set to 0.9 in Slic3r as I have found it prints more accurately on this setting.

# Post-Printing

## Sanding shouldn't be required post printing. Just snap in the bearings like the photos.
