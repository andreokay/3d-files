# Summary

If you print it out please remember to share your make. It's always good to how other people have used the models :) Thanks!

This was designed for use on an IKEA Lack table allowing you to cut a various sizes of holes in the table and inset the grommet. Just choose your size for what you need and get printing! I used the grommet in my 3D printer enclosure but could be used anywhere. Check that out here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2212749 

A square version can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2265185 

Updated (12/04/2017) - I have added all metric sizes in relation to the hole cutter linked below. All grommets are set to be 53mm deep.

Metric - 25, 32 ,38 ,45 ,50 ,56 ,62mm

Updated (22/04/2017) - I have added all imperial sizes in relation to the hole cutter linked below. All grommets are set to be 53mm deep

Imperial - 3/4", 7/8", 1 1/8", 1 1/4", 1 1/2", 1 3/4", 2", 2 1/2", 3", 3 1/2", 4", 5”

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Mk2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.20
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
When you print this be sure to split the cover from the body of the grommet. This can be done in all the slicer programs. this will give you the two parts.

E.g. 
- Simplify3D Its under "Mesh->Separate Connected Surfaces" in S3D.
- Slic3r - Use the split button on the toolbar.

# Post-Printing

Mark and drill a pilot hole straight through the whole table. This will act as your guide when doing the next cut. Then cut a 50mm hole in the top side of the table.

Drill through from the other side using the pilot hole as your guide.

Insert the grommet. It will be a tight fit in the last 2-3mm as it is designed as a push fit to clamp onto the hole you have just created.

Pass through the cable and put on the cover. Job done!

# How I Designed This

These are probably the best value hole cutters you can get for various sizes and will be more than enough for an LACK table.
